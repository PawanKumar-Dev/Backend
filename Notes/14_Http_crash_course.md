# Http Crash Course

- "HTTP" is a protocol that facilitates the exchange of information over the Internet.
  - Simply, HTTP is language that client browser(or any application) communicate with server(or where data is stored).


- HTTP operates on "Request-Response Model" where a client sends a request to the server, and server responds with right data.


- Note: HTTP is a stateless protocol.
  - Meaning each request from a client to a server is independent.
  - There is no inherent memory of previous interactions in Http protocol.
  - Though additional tech (like cookies or sessions) can provide stateful behavior.


- HTTP headers are key-value pairs sent with both HTTP requests and responses.
  - They have metadata such as : content type, caching instructions, authentication tokens, etc.
  - They donâ€™t carry the main content (which is in the body)
  - But provide context for processing the request or response.
  - For e.g., server might look at "Accept header" in request to determine the format (JSON, XML, etc.) in which to return data.


- HTTP methods are set of request types defined by the HTTP protocol.
  - GET: Retrieve data from server without any side effects. Used to fetch and view content.
    ```
    GET /search?query=javascript HTTP/1.1
    Host: www.example.com
    ```
    
  - POST: Send data to server to create new resource or update existing one. For e.g., submitting forms, uploading files etc.
  ```
  POST /submit-form HTTP/1.1
  Host: www.example.com
  Content-Type: application/json
  Content-Length: 45

  { "username": "user123", "password": "securePass" }
  ```
