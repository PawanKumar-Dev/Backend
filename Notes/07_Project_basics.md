# Project Basics

- We can generate our .gitignore professional file by using "git ignore generator".

- Install "nodemon" for auto-restarting node.js server when detect changes in the directory.
  - Most time "nodemon" is installed as dev-dependency.
  - Only available when app is in development mode.
  ```
  npm install --save-dev nodemon
  ```
