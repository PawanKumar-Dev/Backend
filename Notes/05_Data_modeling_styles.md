# Data Modelling Styles

- We can have different data model styles in Mongoose.

- First let's assume we are making a todos app data model.
    - First create "models" folder which houses all models.
    - Next we make "todos" folder which will contain "todos" models only.

- We name our todo's first model as "user.models.js"
    - ".models" is only there to denote that it's a model file.
