# Backend

- Backend Development has two major components to it:
    - Backend Programming Language (like JS, PHP, Python etc.)
    - Database (like MySQL, MongoDB, Postgres etc.)

- At its core, backend stores our data in a database and fetch this data acc to need.

- Most likely we use "framework" with our langauge to make faster and easier to develop.
    - In JS we use "Express.js" framework to communicate with DB
    - "Mongoose" is framework for DB handling.

- We will use Node.js and NPM for development.

- We can initilze a node empty project with:
    ```
    npm init
    ```
